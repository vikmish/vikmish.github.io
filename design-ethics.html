      <h1 class="project-page-h1">Design Ethics</h1>
      <div class="project-page-body-text">The class introduced us to the philosophy of technology and the central theme of our relationship with technology. Many questions were explored and answered like: Are we determined by technology? If that is the case, how? And to what extent? Do we determine technology or should the issue be explored in a radically different way? <br><br>This following  answers helped me in reflecting on what it can mean to be a professional designer and on the ethical entailments of a digital project.</div>
      <div class="questions">What is the project about?</div>
      <div class="answers">With a distributed and applied-design approach, Ruben and I started exploring ways to grow and consume Lemna minor (Duckweed or Water lentils). It is an aquatic freshwater plant with promising traces of proteins and properties of bioremediation. Our initiative, Lemna is an open-source Discord channel that touches upon a series of urgent contemporary scenarios like the future-food alternatives, rural futures and shared-learning. Since its brief kick-off, it’s already resulted in a series of approaches comprising development of a Growth incubator, a hybrid medium monitoring device and a series of consumable products. The project is currently on-going while exploring various transitions towards biologically-revitalised  futures.</div>
      <div class="questions">What are the relevant values for your project for you as a designer?</div>
      <div class="answers">Shared-knowledge, Authenticity, Transparency and Accountability</div>
      <div class="questions">And for the project sponsor?</div>
      <div class="answers">Consciousness, Responsibility and Integrity</div>
      <div class="questions">And for the community?</div>
      <div class="answers">Self-Reliance, Curiosity and Open-ness</div>
      <div class="questions">What conflicts between values might arise?</div>
      <div class="answers">Dependability v/s Alternatives<br>Convenience v/s Sustainability<br>Security v/s Curiosity<br>Commonality v/s Self-reliance<br>Spontaneity v/s Rationality </div>
      <div class="questions-copy">These are the questions that could arise when one looks at these conflicts through these lenses:</div>
      <div class="answers">1. Rights lens: autonomy, dignity, duties, etc.<br><em>What happens with the data gathered from the monitoring tools?Who owns the right to own or share this data?</em></div>
      <div class="answers">2. Justice lens: equality, diversity, fairness, etc.<br><em>Who has access to these tools or ways to fabricate them?</em><br></div>
      <div class="answers">3. Utilitarian lens: harms and benefits, consequences, balance for different stakeholders. Also future generations!<br><em>What if the tool is used to monitor, control or gather non-consensual and unethical data?</em><br></div>
      <div class="answers">4. Common good lens: communities, institutions, individual vs. the common.<br><em>Would these tools promote self-reliance and promote healthier lifestyles?</em></div>
      <div class="answers">5. Virtue lens: character, habits, will we be proud of this?<br><em>Is a healthier lifestyle going to contribute to a better economy and society, and to what extent?</em><br></div>
      <div class="answers">6. Global ethics: is our perspective Eurocentric or &#x27;colonialistic&#x27;?<br><em>Does collecting data from plants and nature satisfy the human idea of control and security? </em><br></div>
      <div class="project-page-h2-copy">20 questions from the Ethics Professor</div>
      <div class="questions">Jump 10 years into the future. How has your solution aged?</div>
      <div class="answers">The community and network has widened and has developed more tools around the similar approach of shared-knowledge.</div>
      <div class="questions">What is the worst that can happen with your solution?</div>
      <div class="answers">Someone uses it to monitor, control or gather non-consensual and unethical data.</div>
      <div class="questions">What arguments would a strong opponent of your solution bring forward?</div>
      <div class="answers">Quality Analysis, Spontaneous alternatives, Market-ready products.</div>
      <div class="questions">Does the solution represent the person you are? Why/why not?</div>
      <div class="answers">Yes, the outcomes of consciousness, self-reliance and transparency towards self, reflect very well within the tools developed within Lemna.</div>
      <div class="questions">Does your solution represent the future you want to strive towards? Why/why not?</div>
      <div class="answers">Yes, a future where citizens are more active and politically conscious, towards tools and policies that better their quality of life.</div>
      <div class="questions">Imagine your solution is analog and not digital.How would the experience be?</div>
      <div class="answers">Parts of solutions at Lemna are already analog. Focusing on future-food alternatives, we developed a series of consumable products that only need a spoon to be savoured.</div>
      <div class="questions">Is there anything in your solution that makes you uncomfortable? What? Why?</div>
      <div class="answers">Communications through and between multiple protocols/components can get messy and take a while to fully understand. Individual digital components have to be rewired and reconfigured in a bottoms-up approach to be debugged.</div>
      <div class="questions">Have you thought about the costs if it were to go wrong? What could they be?</div>
      <div class="answers">Data infringement, Intellectual property violations, Illegal surveillance etc.</div>
      <div class="questions">What small changes could ethically improve your solution?</div>
      <div class="answers">Funding or sponsorship in some ways could improve the system by helping to devise a platform from scratch instead of using other data-hosting websites. The approach could give users more reliance and freedom over the data gathered and analysed.</div>
      <div class="questions">Could your solution be a part of an episode in Black Mirror? Try to imagine the plot</div>
      <div class="answers">The data that is gathered and monitored on the platform could just help the plants/nature into developing some digital consciousness and ways of communication of their own. While the ‘users’ are distracted with life under the autonomy of the device, nature in turn starts monitoring data from humans during times of installation and data maintenance. Over a long and slow period of time, this data gets stored and communicated through embedded mycelium networks across the planet, only to manipulate and eradicate the human race entirely.</div>
      <div class="questions">Imagine that you yourself were the user of your solution or are affected by it in one way or another. Would it be a good or bad experience?</div>
      <div class="answers">Subjective. When it comes to maintenance and debugging it could get quite overwhelming. Tasting the fruition of clean-food and results of self reliance have a joy of their own.</div>
      <div class="questions">Have you personally met the people who are affected by your solution? Why not? Would it have made a difference in the development phase?</div>
      <div class="answers">The Lemna network is still quite limited. We have met some of the people involved in the channel while interacting with the people who have worked and researched around similar solutions.</div>
      <div class="questions">Would it be okay if the principles in your solution were made into general applicable principles? What could go wrong?</div>
      <div class="answers">In my opinion it’d be good for the betterment of species but at the same point it&#x27;s quite debatable. It is infact a devil v/s angel’s debate because to be able to appreciate a certain valuable thing you need to have the contrary of the same in the society.</div>
      <div class="questions">Do you strengthen or challenge the status quo with your solution? Is that good or bad?</div>
      <div class="answers">Lemna challenges the current status quo of the society in many good and bad ways. It helps in filtering food that ends up on our plate through variables that control the ‘bought’ food like quality control, policies and government-devised regulations.</div>
      <div class="questions">Who has the most and least power in your solution?</div>
      <div class="answers">The user has the most control and power while the companies involved in manufacturing of the electrical components and sensors have the least.</div>
      <div class="questions">Does your solution create increased inequality?Why/why not?</div>
      <div class="answers">The solution in fact creates more equality as it gets more widespread and global.</div>
      <div class="questions">Does your solution make people do things they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have done? Is that a problem?</div>
      <div class="answers">The ideologies around open-data, sustainability and regenerative diets have become prominent and wide spoken recently. As the climate crisis is peaking, more and more people are becoming part of the conversation around environmentally low-impact and individually high-impact solutions. It&#x27;s not a problem but a shift instead.</div>
